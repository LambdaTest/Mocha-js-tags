# How to add build tags to automation tests in Mocha-js on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-tags)

If you want to add build tags to group builds in Mocha-js on LambdaTest, you can follow the steps below. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-selenium-sample).

# Steps
With LambdaTest, you can group your test builds with Build tags. These are added for tests by setting the tags in `buildTags` capability. The capabilites are located in `conf/single.conf.js` file.  The code below illustrates the usage:

```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
        "buildTags": ["test-build1","test-build2"]
};
```

## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
